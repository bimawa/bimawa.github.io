# About me
Greetings. My name is Max, aka bimawa.

I'm passionate about crafting robust and user-centric mobile solutions, particularly for the iOS platform. With over 12 years of experience as a software developer, I've evolved from a junior coder tackling complex AMQP protocols to a senior iOS engineer leading SDK development for sports applications at Makeomatic for startups.

My journey began in web and backend technologies—working with Flash, PHP, Java, and more at companies like Sberbank and P2P Technology—but it naturally gravitated toward mobile development. As a Lead iOS Developer at startups such as HappyMama and TradeAndChat, I've architected apps from scratch, refactored legacy codebases, and integrated advanced features like WebRTC, real-time messaging, and advertising SDKs.

Currently, at Makeomatic, I'm building the StreamLayer SDK ecosystem, enabling features like in-game chat, video calls, betting, and statistics across iOS, Android, and web platforms. I'm proficient in Swift and Objective-C, and I thrive on solving system-level challenges with tools like gRPC, AMQP, RabbitMQ, and modern CI/CD pipelines.

Beyond code, I'm committed to systematic problem-solving—my philosophy that "systematicity is the key to success" guides everything I do. I'm also an avid tinkerer with hardware, loving to solder circuits and program microcontrollers like ESP32. Rust is my go-to for creating handy tools that streamline developers' workflows, and I'm a terminal power user who thrives in Linux and Nix environments. Whether whipping up fun party apps in Node.js or diving into intricate projects with Rust, I relish exploring the intersection of software and hardware.
