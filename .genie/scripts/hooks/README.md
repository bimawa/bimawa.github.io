# Genie Git Hooks System

**Purpose:** Enforce quality gates, traceability, and token efficiency at commit and push time.

**Architecture:** Centralized orchestrators (pre-commit, pre-push) call modular validation scripts.

## 📂 Hook Files (Symlinked from `.git/hooks/`)

### 1. `pre-commit.cjs`
**Trigger:** Before every `git commit`
**Purpose:** Fast validation before commit is created
**Exit Code:** 0 (pass) | 1 (fail)

**Execution Flow:**
```
1. Fast-path check (skip if only wish files changed)
2. Secret detection (blocking, prevents credential leaks)
3. Worktree validation (prevent editing Forge worktrees)
4. User file validation (no personal files committed)
5. Cross-reference validation (all @ references valid)
6. Forge task linking (auto-link wishes to Forge tasks)
7. MCP build validation (ensure dist files match source)
8. Token counting (non-blocking, reports usage)
9. Quality gate (non-blocking, warns on bloat)
```

**Performance:**
- Fast-path: <50ms (wish-only commits)
- Full path: ~550ms (all validations)

**Environment Variables:**
- None (runs always)

**Files Called:**
- `helpers/check-secrets.js`
- `prevent-worktree-access.sh` (bash)
- `validate-user-files-not-committed.cjs`
- `validate-cross-references.cjs`
- `forge-task-link.cjs`
- `validate-mcp-build.cjs`
- `token-efficiency/count-tokens.cjs`
- `token-efficiency/quality-gate.cjs`

### 2. `pre-push.cjs`
**Trigger:** Before every `git push`
**Purpose:** Comprehensive validation before code leaves local machine
**Exit Code:** 0 (pass) | 1 (warn) | 2 (block)

**Execution Flow:**
```
1. Auto-sync with remote (rebase if behind)
2. Run full test suite (genie-cli + session-service)
3. Commit advisory (traceability check)
4. Update changelog (non-blocking)
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `GENIE_SKIP_TESTS=1` - Skip test suite
- `GENIE_ALLOW_MAIN_PUSH=1` - Allow push to main without warnings
- `GENIE_SKIP_WISH_CHECK=1` - Skip wish traceability warnings
- `GENIE_SKIP_AUTO_SYNC=1` - Skip auto-rebase

## 🔍 Validation Scripts (Called by Hooks)

### `commit-advisory.cjs`
**Purpose:** Validate commit traceability and conventional commit types
**Hook:** pre-push
**Blocking:** YES (on main) | WARN (on feature branches)

**EXEMPT COMMIT TYPES** (no wish/issue required):
- `docs:` - Documentation updates
- `style:` - Formatting, whitespace
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `chore:` - Maintenance, dependencies, configs
- `build:` - Build system, CI/CD
- `test:` - Test-only changes
- `ci:` - CI/CD configuration

**FEATURE COMMIT TYPES** (require wish or GitHub issue):
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes (MUST have GitHub issue)
- Untyped commits (treated as feature work)
